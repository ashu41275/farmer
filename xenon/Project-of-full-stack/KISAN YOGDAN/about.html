        <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>Farmers are the backbone of our country.They can provide us farmed products.Farmed products might be sold either to a market, in a farmers' market, or directly from a farm. In a subsistence economy, farm products might to some extent be either consumed by the farmer's family or pooled by the community.Many poor farmers in our society do not have proper resources for their farmed products to sell in the market or they don't have tractors or labours to sell that farmed products.We created this website to help those farmers and provide them employment. </p>
